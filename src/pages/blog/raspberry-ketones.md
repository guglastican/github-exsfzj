<h1>What are Raspberry Ketones?</h1>


Raspberry ketones belong to the family of natural compounds called phenolics and they are what give red raspberries their sweet aroma. This ketone is extracted and used in perfumes, food products, and in cosmetics to give the products a sweet smell. The focus here, however, is not on the use of raspberry ketones in the food industry or in the cosmetic industry; the focus here is how raspberry ketones work to contribute to weight loss.

Research on raspberry ketones has been conducted on mice to simulate the effects it would have on humans concerning weight loss. Mice were first put on a high-fat diet, then, the mice were given high doses of the pure extracted compound to find out how raspberry ketones work to prevent weight gain or to promote weight loss. The ketones are thought to work by promoting the breakdown of fats in mice at a dose of about two percent of their body weight.

But how do raspberry ketones work in humans? Research that has been conducted up to now gives great hope for ketones as a weight loss solution. The reason for this is that the research has led to the conclusion that, even in the case of high-fat diets, the intake of raspberry ketones would prevent a substantial elevation in body weight. It achieves that by melting away the fat in the fat-containing cells, also known as adipocytes. Also, raspberry ketones are thought to mimic the effect of a hormone called adiponectin; this hormone is present in thin people mainly. By mimicking adiponectin, raspberry ketones trick the body into thinking it is thin and the body thus burns the fats more readily.

As if that was not enough, there are more ways in which raspberry ketones can work to promote fat loss. How do raspberry ketones work to contribute to the oxidation of fats? They work by playing a role in thermogenesis; this term simply means the oxidation of fats to produce heat. The reason for the success of raspberry ketones in the oxidation of fats is that it behaves in pretty much the same way as the chemicals capsaicin and synephrine, which both play a role in thermogenesis. In increasing thermogenesis, raspberry ketones increase the amount of calories burnt off daily. More calories burnt off means more weight shrugged off!

How raspberry ketones work wonders on promoting fat and weight loss has not only been mentioned in scientific journals but also on TV shows to let people know about the ‘fat-burning miracle’. Not only can the ketones help in a weight loss regime but they are also completely safe for the health, having no side effects whatsoever.

<h2>What is Zotrim?</h2>
Zotrim is an exciting new and natural weight loss supplement that promises to help you lose 5% of your body weight in 6 weeks.  Zotrim is made from three natural plant extracts backed by 8 clinical studies- which should ease consumers minds. Zotrim is not the only product using this exact formulation, one of the “pioneers” being Clinicallix. What exactly makes  these 3 ingredients so effective and popular? What can they do to help you reach your weight loss goals?

Ingredients
Yerba Maté has been used for centuries in Brazil and Paraguay as a beverage. A Spanish explorer recorded that Indians in Paraguay brewed the leaf tea and it “produced exhilaration and relief from fatigue.” It is now considered a National Drink in South America and in Europe it is called “the Green Gold of the Indios.”

##Main Uses of Yerba Mate:

- Allergies/Sinusitis
- One study reveals that Yerba Mate combined with with the plants Guarana and Damiana prolongs gastric emptying, which makes you feel “fuller” longer which helps body weight.

Guarana is a tropical berry that grows in the Amazon Rain Forest that is believed to increase fat burning and increase energy.It is chemically identical to caffeine and has been used for thousands of years by natives to maintain stamina and increase physical endurance. Guarana seeds have up to 7% more caffeine than coffee beans.

Guarana, a caffeine-packed berry, provides more sustainable energy than coffee. It's become popular in the last twenty years and can be found in many fat burners and sports drinks. Some studies have indicated that Guarana has antioxidant and antibacterial benefits. Other studies have shown that Guarana can improve cognitive performance and reduce mental fatigue.

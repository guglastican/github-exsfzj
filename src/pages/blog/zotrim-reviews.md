Ingredients
Yerba Maté has been used for centuries in Brazil and Paraguay as a beverage. A Spanish explorer recorded that Indians in Paraguay brewed the leaf tea and it “produced exhilaration and relief from fatigue.” It is now considered a National Drink in South America and in Europe it is called “the Green Gold of the Indios.”

Guarana is a tropical berry that grows in the Amazon Rain Forest that is believed to increase fat burning and increase energy.It is chemically identical to caffeine and has been used for thousands of years by natives to maintain stamina and increase physical endurance. Guarana seeds have up to 7% more caffeine than coffee beans.

Guarana Caffeine is released more slowly than coffee  providing longer and more sustained energy.  Over the past twenty years  Guarana has gained popularity and can be found in various  fat burners, energy drinks and sports drinks. Some studies have indicated that Guarana has antioxidant and antibacterial benefits. Other studies prove that Guarana improves cognitive performance and reduces mental fatigue.
